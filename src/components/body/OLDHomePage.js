//     <StyledCardLeftColumnText>Thank you for taking the time to visit my Portfolio website. I'm currently studying the Professional Software Development course at Code Clan and whilst my learning is on-going this website will not be fully developed. My plan is to display projects I've made in cards similar to this with Github/website links, screenshots, gifs and videos.</StyledCardLeftColumnText>
//     <StyledCardLeftColumnText>My professional background is in media monitoring after studying Politics and International Relations at the University of Aberdeen. Whilst working I always enjoyed problem solving and automation, attempting to provide technical solutions and workarounds to areas which previously required significant manual labour.</StyledCardLeftColumnText>
//     <StyledCardLeftColumnText>Around this time I also started making my own modifications for computer games and this led to me using tools such as Blender and GIMP. My ability to learn these tools a general demystification of computer programming eventually led to me undertaking basic courses on Code Academy and FreeCodeCamp where I learned HTML, CSS and pre-ES6 vanilla JavaScript. </StyledCardLeftColumnText>

//     <StyledCardRightColumnText>I had heard of Code Clan for many years and in early 2023 I had put myself in a position where I could once again go back into full-time learning. Broadly I've learned and made projects in Python, JavaScript/React, with my learning of Java still on-going.</StyledCardRightColumnText>
//     <StyledCardRightColumnText>I'm now looking to embark on a career in software development where I will continue my learning. Front-end development was initially the appeal but the more I've worked in the backend and as my learning of Java has increased I feel I would be capable of working effectively and enjoying my craft at either end of the tech stack.</StyledCardRightColumnText>

        <p>Booter was my third and final project at CodeClan but also an idea that I've had since early 2018. As such please do excuse a slightly more rambling feel to parts of this article but bare in mind it is ultimately a passion project.</p>
        <p>I like following football - perenial Scottish and English Premier League also-rans Hibs and Spurs - but I don't actually play that much.</p>
        <p>Games used to be organised with my local friends but they largely lost interest and in this group I was clearly one of the least effective players on the pitch.</p>

        </div>
        <div className='image-by-text-div-text'>
        <p>I'd noticed adverts on GumTree, CraigsList and was aware of other groups of acquaintances who play and indeed other apps, but I never much fancied involving myself.</p>
        <p>This is because it's a team game and I have a strange guilt complex, I'd feel worse letting down random people than my friends who know I'm terrible and invite me anyway.</p>
        <p>Whilst considering trying to learn computer programming I was thinking about something I could build and where better to start than something I myself would find useful.</p>
        </div>
        </div> 
        <p>The cliche moment occurred, the shower thought.</p>
        <p>What if I could somehow find people who are equally as bad as me? Or in the unlikely circumstance that first criteria is satisfied, what if I could find people who don't take casual football that seriously and wouldn't mind me floundering around in midfield?</p>
        <h3 className='booter-logo-text'>Booter</h3>
        <p>I shared the idea around and received a good reception but ultimately it remained dormant. I stuck to my previous career and my programming learning was inconsistent and balanced among other hobbies.</p>
        <p>Snap forward to May 2023. My JavaScript group project had just finished and myself and colleagues were toying around with ideas. I suggested my idea again and the response was good, people suggested this was something they'd be tempted to use.</p>
        <p>I ultimately decided to embark on this project by myself to consolidate my learning, but also to have full control of an idea which was special to me and not feel in any rush to complete it, as this is something I continue to work on for the forseeable future.</p>
